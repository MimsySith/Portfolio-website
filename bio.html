        <div id = "divTwo"><span style = "font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold;">My coding journey began when I was about 7-8 years old.</span> My father is a 
            mechanical engineer so we always had computers about the place. I learned to create simple programs on QBASIC at this tender age.
        <br>
        When I was a bit older - not sure when - Visual Basic came out, and I learned some of the extra functionality that
        came with the new language, although it was still very much in the design of the origial BASIC. 
        <br><br>
        When I was 13, I suffered a devastating episode of mental illness, was hospitalised, diagnosed, and spent the next 17
        years either in hospital or incapacitated at home. Don't believe the people who say mental illness isn't as serious as 
        physical illness! <br> At the end of this time, I was finally stabilised on a new medication and began a slow recovery.
        Since my education was interrupted by my long period of severe illness, I found most avenues of study and work closed to me.
        This annoyed me no end because I am far too clever for my own good - when I was assessed at 10 years old, it was found
        I already had attained a late year 9 high school level of literacy and numeracy. <br> But it seemed that in a rarity, the world of coding cared
        less about what bits of paper you had from universities and more about your practical capabilities. I found an RTO that would
        take me, and began learning front and back end development. And here we are today.<br> I am born and bred Australian and currently
        reside in the Victorian city of Melbourne</div>
