
# Conceit and value

The point of this webpage is to show proespective employers that I am competant in HTML5 and CSS3. Future iterations of this website will show competance also in languages such as JavaScript, Python, Django, and SQL.

The **index** file is not my home/home information page, but rather a portal into the website. I did this because I wanted to do a design that is a little different to welcome people in, but that would be distracting to put all throughout the webpage. However, all the pages including the **index** page will follow a common design theme to link them together.

I would hope that my page is simple to navigate, engaging and informative - or at least, as informative as it can be at this early stage when there is not much to inform people of. I would also hope that it shows I can think independantly, and with initiative. To this end, I will be including a coding project I did that is in a language other than what I initially intend to get work coding in - to whit, VB.NET.
