The point of this webpage is to show prospective employers that I am competent in HTML5 and CSS3. Future iterations of this website will show competance also in languages such as JavaScript, Python, Django, and SQL.

The **index** file is not my home/home information page, but rather a portal into the website. I did this because I wanted to do a design that is a little different to welcome people in, but that would be distracting to put all throughout the webpage. However, all the pages including the **index** page will follow a common design theme to link them together.

I would hope that my page is simple to navigate, engaging and informative - or at least, as informative as it can be at this early stage when there is not much to inform people of. I would also hope that it shows I can think independantly, and with initiative.

Most of the coding in this project is my own, except for a JavaScript function that I learned in a Code+ tutorial and adapted slightly. When I say "my own", I mean that I took concepts I had learned and used them without copying verbatim, or used concepts I had learned and combined them in an original manner. Obviously, I learned all the base concepts from someone else.

I did learn some skills whilst doing this project - initially, I couldn't figure out how to remove the underline from the hypertext in the dropdown menu. Eventually, I figured out I had to style the a teg in the class I had assigned to the list objects, instead of styling the id of the list objects. I also had trouble with my form - I wanted to use one submit button for multiple forms. I ended up ditching it and using just one form - I am still not sure if it is even possible to use one submit button for multiple forms. I also learned something about basic webpage design.
